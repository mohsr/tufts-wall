Project title:
====================
Tufts Events Billboard

Problem statement
====================
Posters for events at Tufts usually reside along the stairs leading to the Academic Quad from Tisch Library. These posters are replaced every week and tens of posters go to waste having potentially made little impact on the event's attendance, as not many people both look at and remember these events. We believe this information should be delivered digitally, since the majority of Tufts students already seek information on the web for events they are interested about.

How do you solve the problem?
====================
We want to create a web app, that will display all upcoming events at Tufts with posters advertising them. The posters will be displaced as if they were stuck on a wall. The PDFs of these events will be "stuck onto" an accessible digital wall rather than a single physical one, allowing students to access information about the event while saving on paper as groups can reduce the amount of paper used to advertise their events.

Features to be implemented 
====================
1. A digital brick wall, with posters of events "stuck" onto it.
2. Information boxes about the events, link to relevant URLs when the poster is clicked (Facebook event page, other website, etc.).
3. An event submission button, where an event can be submitted with all information provided. It will need to be verified by an admin before being posted on the website.
4. An admin panel so that events can be approved.

Data used and collected
====================
We would collect the PDF posters for the events and information about them (time, place, links to other resources, etc).

Algorithms and Special Techniques
====================
We won't be using any algorithms or special techniques in this project.

Electronic Mockups
====================
Here is a Balsamiq mockup of our web page running on both laptops and mobile phones:

# Comments by Ming
* This proposal is excellent, well written
* If I recall correctly, I pre-approved the idea
* Here's a thought: will I be able to move/scroll left and right (not up and down) the wall of posters on a desktop screen?  Oh, and select type of (virtual) paper to use?
